Fish's Integrated Minecraft (FIM for short) is a **Minecraft-to-IntelliJ** integration that aims to eliminate tedious tasks when coding.

## 🔨 FIM-Fabric

This repository is the Minecraft part of the project only.

**NOTE: FIM is currently in an _early alpha_ stage, things are bound to break/change!**

## 💾 Installation

_IntelliJ is not required in order to use Minecraft-only features of the mod!_

### Minecraft
> FIM runs on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), and is built to support **latest** versions of Minecraft only.
>
> Download the Fabric Mod from this repository's [releases](https://github.com/FishIntegratedMinecraft/FIM-Fabric/releases) or from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fish-integrated-minecraft).

### IntelliJ
> You can find the IntelliJ plugin inside of IntelliJ, by searching for ``Fish's Integrated Minecraft`` under Plugins!
>
> Otherwise, the plugin is also available in the [IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27606-fish-s-integrated-minecraft), or you can download the jar file directly from the [FIM-IntelliJ repository](https://github.com/FishIntegratedMinecraft/FIM-IntelliJ).
 
**Both the Minecraft Mod & IntelliJ Plugin are free to use for everyone!**
