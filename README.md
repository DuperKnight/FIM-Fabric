## 💾 Installation

_IntelliJ is not required in order to use Minecraft-only features of the mod!_

You can find the IntelliJ plugin on the [IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace](), or you can download the jar file directly from the [FIM-IntelliJ repository]().

**Both the Minecraft Mod & IntelliJ Plugin are free to use for everyone!**
